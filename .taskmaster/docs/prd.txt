# Overview  
A full-stack authentication system built with modern web technologies in a monorepo structure. This project provides a complete foundation for web applications requiring user management and authentication, featuring a MySQL database, NestJS backend API, and React frontend with shadcn/ui components. The system solves the common need for secure user authentication while maintaining code quality standards and development efficiency through proper tooling and containerization.

# Core Features  
## Database Foundation (MySQL)
- **User Data Management**: Secure storage of user credentials and session information
- **Containerized Development**: Docker-based MySQL setup for consistent development environments
- **Data Seeding**: Comprehensive mock data generation for testing and development
- **Schema Management**: Version-controlled database migrations and schema evolution

## Backend API (NestJS)
- **User Registration**: Secure account creation with input validation and password hashing
- **User Authentication**: Login system with JWT token generation and session management
- **Logout Functionality**: Secure session termination and token invalidation
- **API Security**: JWT-based authentication middleware for protected endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive data validation and error handling

## Frontend Application (React + Shadcn)
- **Registration Interface**: Clean, responsive signup forms with real-time validation
- **Login Interface**: User-friendly authentication interface with error feedback
- **Session Management**: Automatic handling of user authentication state across the application
- **Component System**: Consistent UI using shadcn/ui design system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach supporting all device sizes

## Development Standards
- **Code Quality**: Prettier and ESLint integration for consistent code formatting
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized workspace with shared configurations and dependencies
- **Development Workflow**: Automated build, test, and development scripts

# User Experience  
## Primary User Persona
- **New Users**: Individuals seeking to create accounts and access the application
- **Returning Users**: Existing users who need to authenticate and maintain sessions
- **Developers**: Team members working on the codebase with consistent development experience

## Key User Flows
### Registration Flow
1. User navigates to registration page
2. Fills out registration form (email, password, confirmation)
3. System validates input and creates account
4. User receives confirmation and is logged in automatically
5. Redirected to main application dashboard

### Login Flow
1. User accesses login page
2. Enters credentials (email/password)
3. System validates credentials and generates JWT token
4. User is authenticated and redirected to protected area
5. Session maintained across browser refresh and navigation

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks logout button from any protected page
2. System invalidates JWT token and clears session
3. User is redirected to login page
4. All protected routes become inaccessible

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant interfaces with proper contrast and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Fast loading times with optimized bundle sizes
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios
- **Visual Consistency**: Unified design language using shadcn/ui components

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation First (Critical Path)
1. **Monorepo Setup**: Must be completed first as all other work depends on proper project structure
2. **Database Schema**: Required before any backend development can begin
3. **Docker Configuration**: Needed for consistent development environment across team

## Backend Development (Core Logic)
1. **Basic NestJS Setup**: Foundation for all backend features
2. **Database Connection**: Must work before implementing any data operations
3. **User Registration**: First feature that creates data, foundation for authentication
4. **JWT Authentication**: Required for login and protected routes
5. **Login/Logout**: Core authentication features that build on registration and JWT

## Frontend Development (User Interface)
1. **React Setup**: Basic application structure needed for all UI work
2. **Routing**: Must be configured before creating multiple pages
3. **Registration Form**: First user-facing feature, simpler than login (no existing state)
4. **Login Form**: Builds on registration patterns, adds authentication state
5. **Protected Routes**: Requires working authentication system

## Integration Points (Critical Connections)
1. **API Integration**: Frontend forms must connect to working backend endpoints
2. **Authentication State**: Frontend must properly handle JWT tokens and user sessions
3. **Error Handling**: Both frontend and backend must handle and display errors consistently

## Getting to Visible/Usable MVP Quickly
1. **Week 1**: Monorepo + Database + Basic NestJS (foundation)
2. **Week 2**: User registration (backend + frontend) - first working feature
3. **Week 3**: Login system - complete authentication cycle
4. **Week 4**: Polish, testing, and deployment preparation

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
### Database Connection Issues
- **Risk**: MySQL connection problems in Docker environment
- **Mitigation**: Provide clear setup documentation and fallback to local MySQL
- **Backup Plan**: SQLite for development if Docker issues persist

### JWT Security Implementation
- **Risk**: Improper token handling leading to security vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Follow NestJS security best practices and use established libraries
- **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing and code review

### Monorepo Complexity
- **Risk**: Dependency management and build complexity in monorepo setup
- **Mitigation**: Use proven tools (npm workspaces, consistent package.json structure)
- **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions and troubleshooting guide

## MVP Scope Management
### Feature Creep Prevention
- **Risk**: Adding unnecessary features that delay core functionality
- **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to MVP feature set, defer enhancements to Phase 5
- **Focus**: Complete basic auth flow before adding any additional features

### Over-Engineering
- **Risk**: Spending too much time on perfect architecture instead of working MVP
- **Mitigation**: Time-box architectural decisions, prefer simple solutions that work
- **Approach**: Build for current needs, refactor when requirements become clear

## Resource Constraints
### Development Time
- **Risk**: Underestimating complexity of full-stack setup
- **Mitigation**: Break tasks into small, measurable units with clear acceptance criteria
- **Buffer**: Include 20% time buffer for unexpected issues

### Learning Curve
- **Risk**: Team unfamiliarity with NestJS or specific technologies
- **Mitigation**: Provide learning resources and pair programming opportunities
- **Support**: Plan for additional time on first implementation of each technology
